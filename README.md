# Pokemon

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.0.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4321/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# How it works

- All Components are authored with `standalone:true`
- Experimenting with `inject()` instead of traditional Constructor DI
- Using [@ngrx/component-store](https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store) as State Management solution
- Using [Ng-Zorro](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en) for building UI

# Note
- Currently, this project is not responsive for mobile. This feature will be implemented soon.
